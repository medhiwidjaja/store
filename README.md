# Store

A simple checkout system that calculates the cost of a cart of items purchased
and applies any discounts or pricing rules.

## Building the project

First, make sure you have the required software such as `erlang` and `elixir`.
The version I used is listed in the .tool_version file generated by ASDF tool.

## Running the project

Once the dev environment is setup, the system is ready for an interactive
session. 

```bash
$ mix deps.get
...
$ iex -S mix
```

You interact with the checkout line using the server that the project has set up.
The projects has also already with some sample products loaded.

```elixir
iex> alias Store.{Products, Checkout.Server}
iex> coffee = Products.lookup("CF1")
iex> tea = Products.lookup("GR1")
iex> Server.start_link("Line 1")
iex> Server.add("Line 1", tea.code)
iex> Server.add("Line 1", tea.code)
iex> Server.add("Line 1", coffee.code)
iex> Server.apply_discount("Line 1")
iex> Server.total("Line 1")
```

## Running tests

Running test should be easy:

```bash
$ mix test
```

Test coverage is given by the `excoverall` package, that can be run using the following:

```bash
$ MIX_ENV=test mix coveralls
```

## Configuration and data

The project can be configured using the `config/config.exs` file
It contains the path to the seed data for the products and the pricing rules
